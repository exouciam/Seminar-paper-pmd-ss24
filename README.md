# Static code analysis with PMD

## Title

The topic of my seminar paper is: "Static code analysis with Checkstyle and PMD". The aim is to present and compare the features of the two tools.

## Description

Static code analysis makes it possible to find program errors without having to run the program to be tested on test cases. This technique can also be used to detect violations of a "good programming style". Checkstyle and PMD are two tools for static code analysis for Java. In this seminar paper, the features of the two tools will be presented and compared.
